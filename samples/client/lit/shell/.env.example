# Relevance AI Configuration
# For interactive UI responses, use the Tools API (recommended)
# 
# Required: All four variables below must be set for Relevance Tools to work
# If any are missing, the UI will show an error message instead of being blank

# Stack base URL (e.g., https://api-xxxxx.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest)
# Get this from your Relevance AI dashboard - it's the base URL for API calls
# Example: https://api-e8f5c123.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest
VITE_RELEVANCE_STACK_BASE=https://api-xxxxx.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest

# Your Relevance AI project ID
# Found in project settings
VITE_RELEVANCE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Your Relevance AI API key (keep this secret!)
# Never commit this to version control
# Use Vercel environment variables for production
VITE_RELEVANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Your Relevance AI Tool/Studio ID (the interactive tool/studio to trigger)
# This is the specific tool or studio you want to run
# Get this from your studio's settings page
VITE_RELEVANCE_TOOL_ID=your_tool_id

# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (cp .env.example .env)
# 2. Fill in your actual values
# 3. Run: npm run dev
#
# For Vercel deployment:
# 1. Set these variables in Vercel project settings
# 2. Redeploy the project
#
# The app supports two input modes:
# - Simple mode: "hello" -> sends { message: "hello" }
# - Advanced mode: "{...}" -> parses as JSON and sends as params
